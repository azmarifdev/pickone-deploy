                            Yes, all of our outdoor solar lighting products are designed to be weather-resistant and can
                            withstand various weather conditions, including rain and moderate heat. However, extreme
                            conditions like flooding or severe storms may affect their performance. We recommend checking the
                            product specifications for the IP (Ingress Protection) rating to understand the level of
                            protection for each product.

                            a lower capacity. Most of our solar lights can store enough energy to operate for 2-3 days even
                            with minimal sunlight. For optimal performance, place your solar lights in areas that receive
                            maximum direct sunlight during the day.
